SkypeBot-for-groupcalls
=======================

SkypeBot that calls the current group if you type !call. Also answers to !hello.
Messy C# code, but reliable for now. Version 0.0.1. Huge props to Praveen Nair on codeproject for his example. http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/37909/Make-your-Skype-Bot-in-NET
